			      <p><strong>OSC</strong> is a software development consulting company based in Costa Rica, specializing in creating solutions based on Open Source software. We believe in the power of Open Source to provide solutions that are simultaneously cost-effective, useful, and empowering. Open Source is a rising tide in the global economy, and many companies that had not heard of Open Source 3 years ago today have already made the jump, or are seriously considering it. We know that anyone thinking about making the move to Open Source software will have lots of questions, and will encounter problems at some point. We are here to help provide you with answers and solutions.</p>

						<p>If your company has IT needs but you are not sure you can maintain the staff for them in house, OSC can help you by setting up a team that will allow you to focus on your core competencies without the need of expanding your IT budget, hiring and training more staff, or dealing with the vagaries of contracts yourself.</p>

						<p>We guarantee that we will keep the level of confidentiality you or your company requires. At OSC, we believe in always maintaining a good relationship with our partners.</p>

						<p>We are constantly seeking to expand our team of Open Source professionals in Costa Rica. If you are a developer with Open Source experience, we would like to hear from you. Please send us your resume today.ough them.</p>

			      <aside id="philosophy">
			        <p>As software developers we are encountering and solving issues on a daily basis. Small issues and big issues. And frustrating problems that just don’t make any sense, at least not according to the so-called documentation, if we are lucky enough to have any.

							All this is enough to drive us to frequent rants — when things are busted, and raves — when things go better than expected. Indeed there are unexpected moments of delight when someone else has encountered the same problem and already shared a solution, or built a library we can use to overcome it.

							It is in that spirit that we at Open Source Consulting write this blog. We wish to share our rants, raves, and especially solutions with you. Perhaps by sharing we can make your job just a little easier, help you make that deadline a little faster. We look forward to reading your comments and learning from you as well.

							As we say here in Costa Rica,

							Pura Vida!</p>
